On this App I want to make a form that will take info from the front end
and the server connects with the database to save the info then 
we also will up load pic in the local file using multer the only thing we are saving is the 
file name and data to be retrieved from the images folder in the server part
and we after this we will set it up for authorizaton 


fetch(""localhosst:5000/work,
{
    Method:"POST"
    headers:{"content-type/application/json}
    body:JSON.Stringify(body)
}) this is done autiomatically because we got the submit button in the form 

req.file.buffer is where we get the data
